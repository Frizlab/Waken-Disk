# Waken’Disk #

Small Mac OS X application allowing to force hard drives not to go to sleep.

## Why This Project? ##

Some of my disks when not used for a long time go to sleep (the disk stops spinning). When
I try using the disk again, sometimes, Mac OS X tells me the disk has been disconnected,
then mounts it again. To avoid this nasty bug, I wrote an application preventing the disks to go to sleep.

Note: The bug occurs whether the Energy Saver option to allow disks to go to sleep is checked or not. Somehow my disks don’t care about this option.
